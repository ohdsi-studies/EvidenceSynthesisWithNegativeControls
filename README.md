Extending our calibration framework to a multi-database setting, combining it with OHDSI's Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis framework.
Because systematic error is likely correlated between databases (e.g. the same confoudning by indication will likely occur in many places), we cannot simply meta-analyse the calibrated estimates.
Instead both calibration and evidence synthesis must be combined in a single approach that accounts for these correlations.
